          Navigating the world of technology can be full of unexpected challenges and valuable learning experiences, whether you're troubleshooting a
          stubborn PC case, resolving an ATM error, or improving your problem-solving techniques.
          <strong>I remember when I faced a surprisingly tricky problem with my new PC.</strong> I had just bought a new solid-state drive (SSD) and
          was excited to install it. However, I quickly realised that opening up my PC case would be more challenging than I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case was different from any I’d used before. It was tall but compact, with a square shape. The front was made of glass and had stickers
          showing how to open it. Following the instructions, I managed to remove the front panel quite easily. But then I hit a roadblock: I couldn’t
          figure out how to access the internal components, like the motherboard, where I needed to install the SSD.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent what felt like forever examining the exterior of the case, looking for screws or any obvious way to open it up further. It was quite
          frustrating because it seemed like such a simple task, yet I was completely stuck.
        </p>
        <strong>When I encountered this roadblock, I tried a few different approaches to solve the problem:</strong>
        <h4>Trying Something</h4>
        <p>
          First, I closely examined the PC case and followed the instructions on the stickers to remove the front glass panel. Then, I searched for
          any screws that might be holding the rest of the case together, but there were none to be found.
        </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
          Since I couldn't see any obvious access points, I decided to look up more information about the case online. This wasn’t as easy as I hoped.
          I went to the website where I bought my PC and found the model number of the case. Armed with this information, I searched for a guide
          online. Finally, I was able to find detailed instructions on how to open the case properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this whole process, I felt completely clueless. It was frustrating to be stuck on something that seemed like it should be simple.
          I kept thinking, "How hard can it be to open a PC case?" But as I kept hitting dead ends, my frustration grew. It was only after finding the
          right guide online that I finally felt a sense of relief but also silly as it was actually simple to open, I had never had a modern case
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this experience, I learned a couple of important lessons. Firstly, I realised that PC cases have become a lot more advanced than I
          remembered. There wasn't a single screw to remove, except for the tiny one needed to secure the SSD. But more importantly, I learned that
          it's always a good idea to find and read the instructions or documentation first. If I had done that from the beginning, I could have saved
          myself a lot of time and frustration.

        <strong>Not every problem was as confusing though.</strong>
        <p>
          One morning, I arrived at work to find a service request waiting for me. It said that the ATM at one of our branches was displaying an error
          message and wasn't working at all.
        </p>
        <strong>To tackle the ATM issue, I used several problem-solving techniques:</strong>
        <h4>Trying Something</h4>
        <p>
          First, I took an EFTPOS card and tested the ATM at my branch to see if the problem was caused by user error or a system malfunction. It
          turned out to be a system issue.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
        <p>
          Next, I noted down the error message displayed on the screen. The message suggested there was a problem connecting to one of our background
          systems.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking Peers for Help</h4>
        <p>
          Armed with this information, I quickly escalated the issue to my colleagues. They were able to contact the vendor, who fixed the problem
          before the branches opened for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt confident throughout the process because there weren't any surprises. I approached the problem with an open mind and followed a
          strong, structured process and I learned the importance of following a set process and taking advantage of the different skills within my
          team. It's crucial to capture as much information as possible and escalate issues early to ensure a quick resolution.

        <p>
          In my last job, I often felt reluctant to ask for help. My reluctance stemmed from two main sources: my offsider would get frustrated with
          my questions, and my manager often made me feel stupid for asking. This made me hesitant to reach out for assistance, even when I needed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, through some very challenging one-on-one meetings with my manager, I managed to improve my problem-solving techniques. These
          meetings were tough and sometimes confrontational, but I learned to be upfront with my manager and honest with myself. Despite the stress,
          these sessions helped me become better at finding my own answers, taking detailed notes, and improving my relationships with my team.
          However, I never fully felt comfortable asking my offsider for help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next time, I would try to establish a better rapport with my colleagues early on. Open and honest communication is key, so I would express
          my concerns and seek to understand their perspectives. Additionally, I would seek out multiple sources of support, including peers, online
          resources, and professional networks, to avoid over-relying on any one person.
