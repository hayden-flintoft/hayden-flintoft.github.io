        <p>
          Tā Mason Durie's Te Whare Tapa Whā model is a holistic approach to health and wellbeing rooted in Māori values, emphasizing the balance
          between four cornerstones: Taha Tinana (physical health), Taha Hinengaro (mental health), Taha Whānau (family health), and Taha Wairua
          (spiritual health). Here's my wellbeing plan based on this model:
        </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>1. Taha tinana (Physical Health)</h2>
          <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.</p>
          <p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Focus on a balanced diet with traditional and nutritious foods.</p>
          <p><strong>Rest:</strong> Ensure 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night with a consistent bedtime routine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>2. Taha Wairua (Cultural/Spiritual Health)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Connection to Cultural Heritage:</strong> Engage in activities that connect with my cultural heritage, such as visiting landmarks,
            participating in local cultural events, and exploring my family's history.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Development:</strong> Pursue personal interests and activities that enrich my sense of identity and personal fulfilment,
            such as gardening, hiking, or creative arts.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Reflection and Purpose:</strong> Reflect on my life's purpose and ensure my actions align with my values.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>3. Taha whānau (Family Health)</h2>
          <p><strong>Quality Time:</strong> Dedicate time for family activities that enhance togetherness.</p>
          <p><strong>Communication:</strong> Maintain open and honest communication with my family.</p>
          <p><strong>Support Systems:</strong> Build and maintain a supportive network of family and friends.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>4. Taha Hinengaro (Mental Health)</h2>
          <p><strong>Mindfulness and Meditation:</strong> Practice daily to improve focus and reduce stress.</p>
          <p><strong>Learning and Growth:</strong> Continue advancing in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and REACT.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Check-ins:</strong> Regularly Check-in with Family, Homegroup Members, Course Facilitators and Internally to help limit stress,
            ADHD, and anxiety within myself and those around me.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>5. Whenua (Connection to The Land)</h2>
          <p>Take time to experience nature in my everyday environment.</p>
          <p>Appreciate the rustling of leaves, the patterns of flowers (once they bloom), or the sunset from my lounge window.</p>
