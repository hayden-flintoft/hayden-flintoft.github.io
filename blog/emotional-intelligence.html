        Emotional intelligence (EQ) measures our reactiveness and resilience. It’s not innate but a skill we develop over time. As children, we learn
        a lot about EQ by observing how those around us handle stress.
      </p>
      <p>There are five key components of emotional intelligence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Self-awareness: Recognising our own emotions and how they affect our thoughts and behaviour.</li>
        <li>Self-regulation: Managing our emotions in healthy ways.</li>
        <li>Motivation: Using our emotions to achieve our goals.</li>
        <li>Empathy: Recognising and understanding the emotions of others.</li>
        <li>Social skills: Building and maintaining relationships.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Tools for improving EQ</h3>
      <h4>Mindfulness</h4>
      <p>
        This is a skill I've extensively practised. It involves staying grounded and thinking objectively. Even after years of practice, I have good
        and bad days. It requires continuous effort, and if mindfulness doesn’t work as well on some days, be kind to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        When caught in emotions, I close my eyes and do a mental body scan, visualising a beam slowly moving down, helping me focus. Noticing the
        contact points of my feet on the ground or where my body touches a chair can bring calmness. Another technique is to pause, observe my
        feelings, accept them, and then visualise them as clouds slowly drifting away. Remember, emotions aren’t inherently good or bad; everyone
        experiences them, and we can learn to accept them without letting them overwhelm us.
      </p>
      <p>Focusing on our breath can also help. Slowing down your breathing can calm a racing heart.</p>
      <p>
        Mindfulness shouldn’t be reserved for stressful moments. Pause throughout the day to observe your surroundings—notice the sounds, sights, and
        movements. When eating, savour the taste, smell, and texture. Enjoy small moments of bliss wherever you are and whoever you're with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular mindfulness meditation helps you stay present and manage stress. Focus on your breath and observe your thoughts without judgment. This
        practice enhances self-awareness and emotional regulation.
      </p>
      <h4>Self-Mastery</h4>
      <p>
        Self-mastery is the ability to take control of your own behaviour and emotions, aligning them with your long-term goals. It’s about developing
        discipline and resilience to overcome challenges.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Set Clear Goals: Define what you want to achieve and break it down into manageable steps. Clear goals provide direction and motivation.
        </li>
        <li>Develop Discipline: Consistency is key. Create routines that support your objectives and stick to them, even when motivation wanes.</li>
        <li>
          Manage Emotions: Recognise your emotions without being controlled by them. Practice emotional regulation techniques, such as mindfulness and
          deep breathing, to maintain focus.
        </li>
        <li>Seek Feedback: Be open to constructive criticism. Use it as a tool for growth and improvement.</li>
        <li>
          Reflect Regularly: Take time to assess your progress and learn from your experiences. Reflection helps in identifying areas for improvement
          and reinforcing positive habits.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>By cultivating self-mastery, you enhance your emotional intelligence and create a solid foundation for personal and professional growth.</p>
      <h4>Creating Positive Mental Habits</h4>
      <p>Developing positive mental habits is essential for maintaining emotional well-being and fostering resilience.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Practice Gratitude: Regularly reflect on what you’re thankful for. This helps shift your focus from negative to positive aspects of life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cultivate Optimism: Train your mind to see the bright side of situations. This doesn’t mean ignoring challenges but approaching them with a
          solution-oriented mindset.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engage in Positive Self-Talk: Replace self-criticism with affirmations. Encourage yourself as you would a friend, building self-esteem and
          confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop Resilience: View setbacks as opportunities for growth. Embrace challenges and learn from failures, strengthening your ability to
          bounce back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nurture Relationships: Surround yourself with supportive people. Positive social connections can boost your mood and provide a buffer
          against stress.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>By creating positive mental habits, you enhance your emotional intelligence, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
      <h4>Conscious Listening</h4>
      <p>
        Engage fully when others speak. Pay attention to their words, tone, and body language. This improves empathy and strengthens social
        connections, making you more attuned to others' emotions.
      </p>
      <h4>Journaling</h4>
      <p>
        Write regularly about your thoughts and feelings. This practice encourages reflection and self-awareness, helping you process emotions and
        track personal growth over time.
