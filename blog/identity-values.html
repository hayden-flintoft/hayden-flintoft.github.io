      <p>In a workplace environment, I encountered personality conflicts, a lack of understanding about the intricacies of what my role entailed. In this specific example, I reported to a manager who had directed me to go against the company security policy in order for me to complete a task. I myself knew this was wrong, and went directly against policy as well as my own values of professionalism, honesty and integrity. Being very new in the role, I did not want to go against the direction of my manager, however working in the industry, I knew there would be a more secure way to carry out this task. Rather than carry this out as directed, I sought to find a solution that would entail the end user to maintain their security and privacy and by discussing with other colleagues identified a way to be able to do this successfully. On reflection, I feel that going with my instinct and following up with my colleagues was the right decision and was able to deliver on my task while maintaining my values of professionalism, honesty and integrity and was able to impress upon my manager that there were ways of carrying this out without having to break company policy. 
      <p>While working for the same organisation, I encountered various different personalities which were challenging to navigate and caused some tension. I had to adapt in order to be able to mentally thrive, communicate effectively and collaborate with others on projects. I had to be flexible in my approach and adapt my communication style based on the individual I was communicating with. I found by doing this I was able to establish a better connection and rapport with people which ultimately led to better relationships with the wider team. </p>
      <p>Being born and raised in New Zealand, I have been largely influenced by family and community, personal experiences and educational experiences. As I have grown, these influences have shaped how I form relationships, collaborate with others and in every day decision-making. It shapes how I communicate with others, show empathy and navigate conflicts. As a husband and a father, this comes in handy a lot and there is always plenty of opportunity to reflect, learn and grow! I feel lucky to have their support as I continue with my learning journey, doing this to help better support them in the future gives me the motivation to put my best foot forward and get as much out of this as I can. </p>
      <p>Equally, life with 2 children and being the main carer can make life fairly chaotic, what with housework to complete, dinners to cook, and school lunches to be made, so it will likely be the biggest barrier to learning!</p>
