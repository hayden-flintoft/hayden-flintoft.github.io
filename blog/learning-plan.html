    <article>
      <h3>Long-term Goal or Career Pathway</h3>
      <p>My goal is to work as a software and game developer, with a focus on creating engaging games for PC and mobile platforms.</p>
      <h3>Description of Strengths and Limitations When it Comes to Learning</h3>
      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <p>I am largely language agnostic and can pick up languages and skills easily. I enjoy programming and producing clean code.</p>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <p>I have ADHD and anxiety disorders, which make it challenging to balance hyper-focus with periods of low focus. This affects my confidence, especially after setbacks. I am actively working on strategies to manage these challenges and build resilience in professional environments.</p>
      <h3>Non-Technical/Human Skills Development</h3>
      <p>My goal for developing human skills is to develop confidence and resilience to effectively handle technical interviews and new roles in the tech industry. I aim to strengthen my interpersonal skills to communicate effectively with team members and clients.</p>
      <h3>Managing Workload</h3>
      <h4>Productive and Safe Collaboration</h4>
      <p>
        I plan to establish clear communication practices and set boundaries to maintain a healthy work-life balance, particularly by maximizing downtime and rest periods. This includes avoiding screens and mentally disconnecting from projects during breaks to rejuvenate. I will conduct regular check-ins with teammates and facilitators to ensure mutual understanding and adjust workload
        expectations as needed. Additionally, I will keep communication channels open by checking in on my teammates' well-being, recognizing that a supportive environment benefits everyone.
      </p>
      <h4>Handling Pressure</h4>
      <p>When feeling overwhelmed, I will take structured breaks to manage stress. This includes short walks, meditation, or engaging in a relaxing activity. I will maintain a routine that includes physical exercise and sufficient rest.</p>
      <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
      <p>I commit to seeking help promptly by reaching out to facilitators, peers, or mental health professionals when I notice signs of excessive stress or if I'm struggling to meet deadlines.</p>
      <h3>Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h3>
      <p>I expect proactive support and constructive feedback from the facilitation team. This includes clear guidance on projects, timely responses to inquiries, and support in navigating any challenges that arise during the program.</p>
      <h3>Scheduling Information</h3>
      <p>My schedule will will very based on my remaining work period, Coderdojo classes, school holidays and workload. Bellow I have provided my schedule:</p>
