      <h3>Long-term Goal or Career Pathway</h3>
      <p>My goal is to work as a software and game developer, with a focus on creating engaging games for PC and mobile platforms.</p>
      <h3>Description of Strengths and Limitations When it Comes to Learning</h3>
      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <p>I am largely language agnostic and can pick up languages and skills easily. I enjoy programming and producing clean code.</p>
      <p class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong> - Having background knowledge of other programming languages helped me understand some aspects of the stack used in Bootcamp. However, I found React, JavaScript, and other
        frameworks and libraries to be quite different from the Object-orientated languages I had previously worked with.
      </p>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <p>
        I have ADHD and anxiety disorders, which make it challenging to balance hyper-focus with periods of low focus. This affects my confidence, especially after setbacks. I am actively working on
        strategies to manage these challenges and build resilience in professional environments.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong> - Managing my ADHD and anxiety has been a bit of a mixed experience. There were moments when I struggled with either being too distracted or hyperfocused, which made it
        difficult to absorb the material. These fluctuations affected my confidence at times, but I reminded myself to practise self-compassion and use the strategies I’ve been developing to manage
        these challenges. By taking breaks and adjusting my focus, I was able to regain momentum and eventually grasp the material, reinforcing my resilience in the process.
      </p>
      <h3>Non-Technical/Human Skills Development</h3>
      <p>
        My goal for developing human skills is to develop confidence and resilience to effectively handle technical interviews and new roles in the tech industry. I aim to strengthen my interpersonal
        skills to communicate effectively with team members and clients.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong>- I feel I have made significant progress towards this goal. I have been able to communicate clearly and collaborate effectively with both my team and facilitators.
        Additionally, I’ve become more proactive in seeking help when necessary, which has improved my ability to work as part of a group. While there is still much to learn about teamwork in a coding
        environment, I believe I’ve established a strong foundation in communication and collaboration.
      </p>
      <h3>Managing Workload</h3>
      <h4>Productive and Safe Collaboration</h4>
      <p>
        I plan to establish clear communication practices and set boundaries to maintain a healthy work-life balance, particularly by maximising downtime and rest periods. This includes avoiding
        screens and mentally disconnecting from projects during breaks to rejuvenate. I will conduct regular check-ins with teammates and facilitators to ensure mutual understanding and adjust
        workload expectations as needed. Additionally, I will keep communication channels open by checking in on my teammates' well-being, recognising that a supportive environment benefits everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection"><strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong>  - I feel like I achieved this.</p>
      <h4>Handling Pressure</h4>
      <p>
        When feeling overwhelmed, I will take structured breaks to manage stress. This includes short walks, meditation, or engaging in a relaxing activity. I will maintain a routine that includes
        physical exercise and sufficient rest.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong> - I felt that I generally managed the pressure well and kept up with the course workload. However, during the beginning of Phase 3, I experienced burnout, struggling to
        recall information and feeling mentally exhausted. Recognising this, I reached out to my facilitator and took the weekend off. This break helped me reset, and I returned the following week
        feeling recharged and better able to manage the workload.
      </p>
      <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
      <p>I commit to seeking help promptly by reaching out to facilitators, peers, or mental health professionals when I notice signs of excessive stress or if I'm struggling to meet deadlines.</p>
      <p class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong> - I realised I could have sought help more often and earlier when I was struggling with the material. While I made a strong effort to find solutions independently, which
        worked most of the time, there were several moments when reaching out sooner would have been more effective. Overall, I think I maintained a reasonable balance between solving problems on my
        own and asking for help, but there's room for improvement in seeking support more proactively.
      </p>
      <h3>Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect proactive support and constructive feedback from the facilitation team. This includes clear guidance on projects, timely responses to inquiries, and support in navigating any
        challenges that arise during the program.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">
        <strong>Reflection: Week 7</strong> - I found the facilitation team met my expectations well. The material was clear, and whenever I needed support, it was readily available. Their guidance helped me navigate
        challenges, and responses to my inquiries were timely and helpful. While the onus was on me to reach out for help, I felt supported by the facilitation team throughout the course.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Information</h3>
      <p>My schedule will will very based on my remaining work period, Coderdojo classes, school holidays and workload. Bellow I have provided my schedule:</p>
      <p class="update"><strong>Updated 2024-09-08</strong> to reflect that the schedule is not as hectic as initially planned. On Thursday the 19th of September I will study from Wellington and attend the Summer of Tech Meet and Greet.</p>
